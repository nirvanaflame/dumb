/**
 * You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. 
 * Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. 
 * The street looks something like this:
 * 
 * 1|   |6
 * 3|   |4
 * 5|   |2
 * 
 * Evens increase on the right; odds decrease on the left. 
 * House numbers start at 1 and increase without gaps.
 *  When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2.
 * 
 * 
 * @param {Number} address of a person 
 * @param {Number} n max houses on a street
 * @returns address of opposite house number
